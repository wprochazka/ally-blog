        Today in our bibble study we learned about how Joseph  and his brothers getting to know each other because Josephs brothers sold him and now there really regretting it. My awesome dad was here again and I helped him out. I helped him pick up sticks, branches, and twigs. Then I got scraped a lot and decited to go back in side and read for a little bit. After reading I decided to play backgammon with my mom but she said she was to busy.So I played with my brother insted. After my mom came back in from outside, she played backgammon with me. Then I won! I had a lot of fun today. The one thing I love most is at the end of the day when we all get together and whatch the opal hunters on TV. The opal hunters is a good show. Opal is a precious kind of rock. It's made out of water flowing down a clif and at the bottom of the clif, it makes opal. Opal can be millions of dollars. That's why people lok for them. The rarest kind is read opal. It costs A LOT!! But it's really hard to find opal. You have to dig really deep in the ground. I know a lot of you out there like getting a prize when you do something like this. Well good news for you, you get opal as your prize, and money! The opal hunters is a good show. You should whatch it. Thank you for reading my blog. PEACE OUT!!!

        Today I listened to our bible study and learned that Joseph got to see his dad for the first time since he was sold in to slavery. Then we took the dogs for a walk up and down are drive way twice. After that we went to get food for lunch at the school and our packets of homework. Then I did the exercises that my coach sent. One of the exercises that she sent was sprinting in your back yard. insted of my yard, I sprinted a quarter of my drive way but racing my brother on a bike. I won most of the times but my brother won some. After that I did all my homework. it was a good day at home today. I hope yall had as much fu as I had. Thank you for reading my blog!              PEACE OUT!!!!
