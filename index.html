        Today in our bibble study we learned about how Joseph  and his brothers getting to know each other because Josephs brothers sold him and now there really regretting it. My awesome dad was here again and I helped him out. I helped him pick up sticks, branches, and twigs. Then I got scraped a lot and decited to go back in side and read for a little bit. After reading I decided to play backgammon with my mom but she said she was to busy.So I played with my brother insted. After my mom came back in from outside, she played backgammon with me. Then I won! I had a lot of fun today. The one thing I love most is at the end of the day when we all get together and whatch the opal hunters on TV. The opal hunters is a good show. Opal is a precious kind of rock. It's made out of water flowing down a clif and at the bottom of the clif, it makes opal. Opal can be millions of dollars. That's why people lok for them. The rarest kind is read opal. It costs A LOT!! But it's really hard to find opal. You have to dig really deep in the ground. I know a lot of you out there like getting a prize when you do something like this. Well good news for you, you get opal as your prize, and money! The opal hunters is a good show. You should whatch it. Thank you for reading my blog. PEACE OUT!!!

There about to have babies! We chased them and they were so funny! We got four goats but we only named three. There names are Oreo, Peewee, and Sandy. They were fun but I did other things than goats. I did a nerf gun fight with my brother and sister. We had forts set up every where around the house. We only had three lives and I shot my brother twice! My sister and I were on a team and my brother wanted to be solo. We had so much fun. We also planted a garden. We planted watermelon, pickles, swiss chard, and other things. We also did are homework, like always.We did our bible study and leaned that Jacob was about to die so he blessed Joseph two sons. Thank you so much for reading my blog!!     PEACE OUT!!!

First I would be on bryn's team then if will shot me I would be on his team. That was really fun.Then my mom told us to take these to the back. So we did. We went to a big tree and started chunking them at it. I decited that I wanted to play egg ball. So I told my brother to pitch me and I got a stick and hit the ball. It turns out it wasn't the greatest idea.Guess what happend with the yolk?! It got all over my shirt!! I had a cat shirt on and when my mom asked what happend, I said the cat threw up. she diden't belive me, and I diden't have a plan B. It diden't go over well.I took a shower so I diden't have egg yolk all over me. Then we did our walk and our bible study.We are in Exodux. I had a lot of fun today!

        Today in our bible study I learned the rest of the plagues. The rest of the plagues are the locusts every where in Egypt,then darkness, and finally each first born (that was a boy) would be killed. Since it is Saturday my dad was home! We watched funny cat and dog videos and my favorite one was the one that barked at the door until the mail man would put the mail through the door then riped it up in two seconds!!! Then it would keep on barking. It was sooooo funny!!! Then we helped my sister finish a three D puzzle!! What!? I really diden't really do any thing but I helped a little. Then we came inside and played another game of ticket to ride. My dad won so woop woop for him!! There were four people playing and I got third. Seconed to last. It was a really fun game. I love being with my family, especially when my dad is home because that means it's a full family.It was a really fun day. Thank you so much for reading my blog. PEACE OUT!!

        Today my mom made pancakes for us this morning to surprize us. She is sooo sweeet!! They were so good. Then we did our chores and mine is to feed the cats and dogs and get there water.We didn't have school homework because it is Sunday. My brother and I had a nerf gun duel. This is how it works. First you and someone else will stand back to back. Then you take three steps forward. After that you turn around and shoot. If you got shot then the other person wins and if you shoot them then you win and if both of yall miss, then it is a free for all. That was my day! Thank you for reading my blog! PEACE OUT!!
