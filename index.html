        Today in our bibble study we learned about how Joseph  and his brothers getting to know each other because Josephs brothers sold him and now there really regretting it. My awesome dad was here again and I helped him out. I helped him pick up sticks, branches, and twigs. Then I got scraped a lot and decited to go back in side and read for a little bit. After reading I decided to play backgammon with my mom but she said she was to busy.So I played with my brother insted. After my mom came back in from outside, she played backgammon with me. Then I won! I had a lot of fun today. The one thing I love most is at the end of the day when we all get together and whatch the opal hunters on TV. The opal hunters is a good show. Opal is a precious kind of rock. It's made out of water flowing down a clif and at the bottom of the clif, it makes opal. Opal can be millions of dollars. That's why people lok for them. The rarest kind is read opal. It costs A LOT!! But it's really hard to find opal. You have to dig really deep in the ground. I know a lot of you out there like getting a prize when you do something like this. Well good news for you, you get opal as your prize, and money! The opal hunters is a good show. You should whatch it. Thank you for reading my blog. PEACE OUT!!!

        Today I listened to our bible study and learned that Joseph got to see his dad for the first time since he was sold in to slavery. Then we took the dogs for a walk up and down are drive way twice. After that we went to get food for lunch at the school and our packets of homework. Then I did the exercises that my coach sent. One of the exercises that she sent was sprinting in your back yard. insted of my yard, I sprinted a quarter of my drive way but racing my brother on a bike. I won most of the times but my brother won some. After that I did all my homework. it was a good day at home today. I hope yall had as much fu as I had. Thank you for reading my blog!

        Today I woke up and we had fainting goats in are back yard. There sooo funny!! Fainting goats are goats that if you scare them, they will faint. Two of them are pregnant. There about to have babies! We chased them and they were so funny! We got four goats but we only named three. There names are Oreo, Peewee, and Sandy. They were fun but I did other things than goats. I did a nerf gun fight with my brother and sister. We had forts set up every where around the house. We only had three lives and I shot my brother twice! My sister and I were on a team and my brother wanted to be solo. We had so much fun. We also planted a garden. We planted watermelon, pickles, swiss chard, and other things. We also did are homework, like always.We did our bible study and leaned that Jacob was about to die so he blessed Joseph two sons. Thank you so much for reading my blog!!     PEACE OUT!!!

        Today was April fools! We did a nerf gun fight and instead of me fighting with my brothers and sisters, I decited to be the bullet picker uper. First I would be on bryn's team then if will shot me I would be on his team. That was really fun.Then my mom told us to take these to the back. So we did. We went to a big tree and started chunking them at it. I decited that I wanted to play egg ball. So I told my brother to pitch me and I got a stick and hit the ball. It turns out it wasn't the greatest idea.Guess what happend with the yolk?! It got all over my shirt!! I had a cat shirt on and when my mom asked what happend, I said the cat threw up. she diden't belive me, and I diden't have a plan B. It diden't go over well.I took a shower so I diden't have egg yolk all over me. Then we did our walk and our bible study.We are in Exodux. I had a lot of fun today! Thank you for reading my blog!!                           PEACE OUT!!

        Today we did our bible study and learned that God told Mosses that he wanted him to save the Israelites. The bible is really intense! then we went on our walk as usual. Then we played a game of ticket to ride. it was intense!!! My brother always wins the games, but not today!! I won the game of ticket to ride! I was so happy! I even won the TEN EXTRA points! boy ya!! It was so much fun playing the game. We finish up with homework and went down to the drainage ditch down our drive way. We caught three craw fish. When we got back, we sat on the porch and ate popsicles. Then our dad came down the drive way and surprized us! supposedly, my dad came back from work early or something. I was so excited!!! so that was my exciting day! Thank you for reading my blog! PEACE OUT!!
